# shading-library beta release
Production Shading Library

The Production Shading Library refers to [Laika's](https://www.laika.com) entire collection of VFX production shading capabilities. These are embodied primarily in the set of shading-library files.

This repository will contain those portions of Laika's Production Shading Library that have been released as open source.

This beta release contains a set of shading nodes that provide a [Material Layering System](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/Material-Layering-System) based on [Pixar's](https://www.pixar.com) [RenderMan](https://renderman.pixar.com/product). This system has been implemented for a future production, and has yet to be thoroughly tested. Please provide feedback on any bugs or feature requests.

## Requirements
* [Pixar's](https://www.pixar.com) [RenderMan 22](https://rmanwiki.pixar.com/display/REN22/RenderMan)
* [Pixar's](https://www.pixar.com) [RenderMan 22 for Katana 3.0](https://rmanwiki.pixar.com/display/RFK22/RenderMan+22+for+Katana)
* [Foundry's](https://www.foundry.com) [Katana 3.0](https://www.foundry.com/products/katana)

An update of the Material Layering System that includes support for Maya 2018 will come soon.
